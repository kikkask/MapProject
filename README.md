# Map Project
The goal of this project is to create a map visualization for an aviation company's market share to to facilitate market analysis by the salespeople.

All data used in this project is fake.

# Problem Statement

**Problem:** The files and graphs used for market analysis did not facilitate understanding and salespeople wasted a lot of time compiling the information.

**Proposed Solution:** Using Python, create a map containing all the information needed to perform a market share analysis, including country data, such as population and economy, thus facilitating the analysis of the current situation of the company's market by supervision and salespeople.

# Process

Using the geojson.io platform, a json data file was created containing the necessary data plus the data for plotting the map.

The data from the geojson file was loaded into the python notebook using the geopandas library. After that, codes were written to plot the map and save it in an HTML file that was distributed to stakeholders to facilitate the visualization of the information.

# Conclusion of the Project

Through this project I was able to successfully build a map with the data from market share team. And as a result we have a more compact and simplified view so that more complete and faster market share analyses can be performed. This helps us get some useful insights on the market share information.
